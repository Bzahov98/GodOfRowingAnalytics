My first idea of a project, which I started to develop, for my diploma work at my University TU-Sofia titled: 

<i><b>Analysis and control for Rowing sport process, with Android App and Web Server.</b></i>

### Later on, I decided to do another project [(can be found HERE)](https://github.com/Bzahov98/RowingBG_Achievements) for my diploma work and leave this for later. Its title is: 

[<i><b>Platform for information of BFG(Bulgarian Rowing Federation), with Android App.</b></i>](https://github.com/Bzahov98/RowingBG_Achievements)
